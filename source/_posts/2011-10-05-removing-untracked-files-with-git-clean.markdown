The BEST thing abt pair-programming is that it facilitates knowledge
diffusion. Just pick up `git clean` from coworker

today.

`git clean` makes it real easy to remove untracked files in ur working
git repo. Files/dirs listed in `.gitignore` are ignored (as expected),
only those extra untracked files are cleaned off.

Honestly, nothing beats `git help clean` if u want to learn more abt it.
