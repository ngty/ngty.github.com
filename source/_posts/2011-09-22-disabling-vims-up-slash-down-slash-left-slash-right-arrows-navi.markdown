While doing pairing, a coworker of mine has been promiscuously using
up/down/left/right arrows navigation, to that extent that it pissed me
off & i went ahead disabling that feature while he took break.  To
my DISMAY .. he resorted to promiscuously using h/j/k/l instead :(

Anyway, here's the [stackoverflow post that provides the settings to
disable the up/down/left/right arrows navigation
